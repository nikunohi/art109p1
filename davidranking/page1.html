    <p>hi this is david and here is my ranking of the worst parking 
        in the west garage
    </p>
    <p>Artist statement : While the feeling of rush is something everyone 
        can feel it can lead often to sloppyness and cause someone to make 
        mistakes. The irony of causing someone else to be late while you are
        trying to make it on time is something not often thought about.
        Here is the top 5 laziest/ worst parking jobs that were in the west parking
        garage.
