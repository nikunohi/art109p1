    <p>hi this is david and here is my ranking of the worst parking
        in the west garage
    </p>
    <p>Artist statement : While the feeling of rush is something everyone
        can feel it can lead often to sloppyness and cause someone to make
        mistakes. The irony of causing someone else to be late while you are
        trying to make it on time is something not often thought about.
        Along with that big mistakes can be made in the rush to get on time
        resulting in tricky situations that are hard to overcome.

<p> while not bad this was definatly sloppy work, it would have been easy to repark
</p>


<header>number4</header>

</p>This where things get bad, this prius could have just tried again and repark
but instead chose to stay.</p>


<header>number3</header>

<p>This is just really bad and a good example of what I mean when
    someones sloppyness can affect other people, because of the white car
    the green car on the right also has bad parking.

<p>This is definalty one of the worst parking I have ever seen,
    becuase of the white rav 4 the spot on the left is no longer useable
</p>


<head>number1</head>
<img src="images/parkedcar1.PNG" alt="worst1" >

no idea how this even happend</p>
