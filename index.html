        <p>	At its surface, this webpage chronicles the worst parked vehicles at the university’s parking garages, determined via the judgment of two students, one who exclusively rides the bus and another who—during the process of completing this archive—scraped another car while parking.(We are very qualified) If we dig a little deeper, however, not only does it investigate the circumstances behind cases of bad parking, it also asks questions about what we consider bad parking, and the attitudes and actions we take when we see instances of bad parking. By better understanding our feelings towards bad parking, as well as by understanding different responses to witnessing it, we can exercise more careful and fair judgment when making use of one of the most popular and chaotic shared spaces—a university parking garage.
</p>
<p>We have gathered a collection of poorly parked cars, presented them with the essential details behind their parking job to give necessary context with as little bias as possible. Viewers can then reserve their kneejerk responses until after carefully processing the details behind the parking job. This reflection gives viewers an opportunity to better understand their place in maintaining the delicate emotional social balance of a mass shared space.
